<p>Cerebral (brain) atrophy refers to a loss of brain tissues, including neurons and the connections between them. “Brain shrinkage” also falls under the umbrella of brain atrophy. It can apply to the entire brain or certain sections only.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Causes of brain shrinkage include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>traumatic brain injuries</li><li>stroke</li><li>degenerative brain diseases, such as dementia</li><li>infectious diseases that cause significant inflammation, such as AIDS and encephalitis</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research is ongoing to see whether COVID-19 is an infectious disease that can cause your brain to shrink.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this article, we’ll review what studies have revealed so far about COVID-19’s effects on the brain.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For reasons not yet understood, some people who develop a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-theres-a-big-difference-between-a-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-person-testing-positive-for-covid-19">COVID-19 infection</a>&nbsp;may experience symptoms for several weeks, months, or years after recovery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These post-COVID conditions are commonly known as “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long COVIDTrusted Source</a>.” It occurs in people who’ve recently had COVID-19 and experience new, recurring, or ongoing symptoms 4 weeks or longer after the initial onset of infection.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brain shrinkage is one such condition that may arise from long COVID. It has been garnering attention among researchers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, one&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04569-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 studyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;used two&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mri-detects-abnormalities-in-brain-depression">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</a>&nbsp;brain scans in 785 participants. Researchers found brain changes in the 401 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 between each scan. Changes included:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>reduced gray matter (the outer layer of the brain)</li><li>tissue damage in areas of the brain connected to smell</li><li>decreased brain size</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The study also found that the same participants who showed brain shrinkage were at a greater risk of experiencing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cognitive-decline">cognitive decline</a>. There was more tissue damage in the areas of the brain that control&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-loss-of-taste-loss-of-smell">smell</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2790595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Possible explanationsTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;for brain shrinkage related to COVID-19 infection include inflammation or direct viral infection of the brain cells. But it’s important to note that most of the data were from before COVID-19 vaccines were available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2033369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;also used MRI techniques to evaluate the brains of those who experienced COVID-19 infection. Here, researchers found damage to the small blood vessels in the brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to the small size of the study and other limitations, researchers couldn’t make definite conclusions about how COVID-19 affects the brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many studies have linked COVID-19 to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-and-blood-clots">blood clots</a>. This link may relate to damage to the blood vessels in the brain. The potential for blood clots in your brain also raises your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849983/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk of strokeTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;after COVID-19 infection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9189797/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">researchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;has found that proteins on the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be toxic to the neurons in your brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/145/7/2555/6621999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022 study</a>&nbsp;also noted brain injuries in patients who died from complications related to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (March to July 2020). Researchers found evidence of protein leaks and neuron damage while conducting brain autopsies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They also suggested that clinicians pay more attention to brain changes in people who survive COVID-19 infection and complain of cognitive symptoms that could be signs of long COVID.</p>
